                        <p>He grew up with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. Jobs remembers his father as being very skilled at working with his hands.</p>

                        <p>In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California. This area, just south of Palo Alto, California, was becoming a center for electronics. Electronics form the basic elements of devices such as radios, televisions, stereos, and computers. At that time people started to refer to the area as <b>"Silicon Valley."</b> This is because a substance called silicon is used in the manufacturing of electronic parts.</p>
                            
                        <p>As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself. He swam competitively, but was not interested in team sports or other group activities. He showed an early interest in electronics and gadgetry. He spent a lot of time working in the garage workshop of a neighbor who worked at Hewlett-Packard, an electronics manufacturer.</p>
                            
                        <p>Jobs also enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club. There he saw engineers demonstrate new products, and he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers.</p>

                    <p>In Walter Isaacson’s biography, Jobs reveals that he’d come up with the name while “on one of my fruitarian diets.” Having just visited an apple farm he thought the name sounded “fun, spirited and not intimidating.” According to Steve Wozniak: “I remember I was driving Steve Jobs back from the airport along Highway 85. Steve was coming back from a visit to Oregon to a place he called an “apple orchard.” It was actually some kind of commune. 
                        
                        <h3>Steve suggested a name – Apple Computer</h3></p>
